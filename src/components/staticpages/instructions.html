    <p>
      This form is to be used for the Clinical Evaluation Tool (CET) for
      students in the BCIT Critical Care Nursing Specialty Program. The CET
      is a formative assessment tool that is used to assess the student’s
      clinical performance in the critical care environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CET is divided into two sections: the KAP and the comments section.
      The KAP section contains a list of clinical practice indicators that
      are used to assess the student’s performance. The comments section is
      used to provide additional feedback on the student’s performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The KAP section is divided into six levels of performance: Not
      Assessed, Unable to demonstrate competence, Marginal, Able to do with
      assistance, Able to do with supervision, and Able to do
      independently. The student’s performance is assessed based on the
      clinical practice indicators listed in the KAP section.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comments section is used to provide additional feedback on the
      student’s performance. This feedback should be specific and
      constructive, and should focus on the student’s strengths and areas
      for improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CET is to be completed by the student’s preceptor or clinical
      instructor. The preceptor or clinical instructor should review the
      student’s performance in the clinical setting and provide feedback
      based on the clinical practice indicators listed in the KAP section.
      The preceptor or clinical instructor should also provide feedback in
      the comments section.
